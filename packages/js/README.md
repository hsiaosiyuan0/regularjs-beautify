# regularjs-beautify-js

Easy to format all the templates inside a JavaScript file. It **only** takes care of the style of those template strings beginning with the specific html comment - `<!-- @regular -->`. 

Feel free to chain this tool before/after other JavaScript code formatter, it will not conflict with the others since it only work on Regularjs templates and do not touch the other parts of our source code.
