# regularjs-beautify

This is the missing code formatter of [Regularjs](https://regularjs.github.io/). Its functionalities are split into several packages:

- [Core](packages/core/README.md) - The core logic of beautifying
- [ESLint](packages/eslint/README.md) - ESLint plugin, for style lint and auto-fix
- [Dozen](packages/dozen/README.md) - Easy to format all the templates inside a JavaScript file

You'll not use the Core directly in most situations, consider to use the downstream repositories according to you requirements.

Feel free to leave any messages via Issues.
